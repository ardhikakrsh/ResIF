# Reserve IF - ResIF 
ResIF (Reservasi IF) is a mobile room reservation app for the Department of Informatics Engineering, ITS. This application is a mobile adaptation of the web-based reservation system available at reservasi.if.its.ac.id, rebuilt using Flutter and Firebase. This project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to maintain a clean separation of concerns and ensure maintainability. The purpose of this mobile version is to provide a more practical, responsive, and accessible experience for booking classrooms, labs, and other department facilities — directly from mobile devices.

## 📂 Features
- 🔐 Secure login & registration (Firebase Auth)
- 📖 Booking guidelines and department rules

## 🚧 Feature Under Maintenance
